## Description

This is an iOS compatible side-scrolling, 2D, aquatic-themed, multi-level game
that allows single-handed game-play. The object of the game is for a user to
move their character across dangerous waters collecting Pellets in a given
amount of time while avoiding other creatures and hooks. This game was inspired by FlappyBird but has an underwater twist.

## Live Demo Instructions
